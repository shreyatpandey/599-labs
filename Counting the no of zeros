Write a program in C to solve the following question: 
 
Q: given a natural number larger than 100, find the number of 0s in front of n! (n factorial). 
 
For example:  For n=5, the answer is 1, for n=10 the answer is 2, for n=26, the answer is 5. 
 
Caution: you may write a for loop for calculating n! and then counting the 0s, but as n grows, the n! grows with an exponential rate. 
Therefore, for n > 100, even using 64bit variables, you cannot calculate the answer correctly, because there will be an overflow! 
 
Hint: find the number of 5s and 2s, because the multiplication of those numbers create 0 in front of n!. 
Be careful to count those numbers correctly. For example, 25 creates two 5s.
