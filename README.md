To implement the lab, I have taken help from following source
(a) www.geekforgeeks.com :- In the program zerocount.c, it has been mentioned on the part where I have used it to implement the function.
(b) For part 2 , it has been mentioned just after the answer from where I got the help

Concern and grading part: -
â€¢	I have submitted 2 parts for zerocount.c . In zerocount1.c, I have used the basic approach of calculating the factorial and then through prime factorization methodology obtained the number of prime factors of 2,3 and 5. I observed that this works for very small values probably till n=20. In zerocount.c , I have used method of finding only no of prime factor of 5 . This program works for any value of input.
