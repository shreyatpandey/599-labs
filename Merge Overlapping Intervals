Problem Statement:-
Very often you are given a collection and you need to find the superset. Therefore in this problem you will be given a list of intervals and you need to merge all overlapping intervals. 
 
For example  Given [1,4],[2,5],[6,11],[13,15], you should return [1,5],[6,11],[13,15].  
 
(Only one overlap in this case)  If one interval ends on the same number as the next intervals starts, you should merge them too. 

You must write you own testing function in a different file test.c( which contains the main() function) to check its functionality.
Make sure that the submission interval.c does not have a main function, since we will be using our own main functions to call the merge() function above
