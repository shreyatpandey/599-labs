# Merge Overlapping Intervals


Problem Statement:-
Very often you are given a collection and you need to find the superset. Therefore in this problem you will be given a list of intervals and you need to merge all overlapping intervals. 
 
For example  Given [1,4],[2,5],[6,11],[13,15], you should return [1,5],[6,11],[13,15].  
 
(Only one overlap in this case)  If one interval ends on the same number as the next intervals starts, you should merge them too.

To implement the lab, I have taken help from following source
(a) www.geekforgeeks.com :- In the program zerocount.c, it has been mentioned on the part where I have used it to implement the function.
(b) For part 2 , it has been mentioned just after the answer from where I got the help

Concern and grading part: -
â€¢	I have submitted 2 parts for zerocount.c . In zerocount1.c, I have used the basic approach of calculating the factorial and then through prime factorization methodology obtained the number of prime factors of 2,3 and 5. I observed that this works for very small values probably till n=20. In zerocount.c , I have used method of finding only no of prime factor of 5 . This program works for any value of input.
